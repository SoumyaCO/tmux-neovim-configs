# Tmux and NeoVim Configuration files
## As a backup

NeoVim is a large part of my day to day tasks (development, note taking etc .)

Here are some screenshots

1. Tmux Configs 
I'm using `catppuccin` theme (config2)
**To get this style** copy the `.tmux.conf` file and paste it into your home folder and reload tmux.

2. NeoVim Config 
Here I'm using some customized neovim config, made by some extremely talented person. (in github)
**To get this style** copy `nvim` directory and paste it inside your `.config/` directory. (latest Neovim required)
